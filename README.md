My Portfolio Site

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following -

BEM methodology
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable

Bootstrap
Help me to develop device friendly website.The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths

CSS Grid & Flexbox
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. .

JavaScript
I created functions to animate the Project section projects, depending on the button selected on the page.
